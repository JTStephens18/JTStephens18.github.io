I am a software engineer with a focus on computer graphics and 3D computer vision. I aim to build generative virtual worlds for applications in robotics, media, and entertainment. I think this area of work is really cool and I want to build cool stuff with cool people. I'm currently open to exploring new opportunities. So, if you have anything I might find interesting, don't hesitate to reach out!
